Tracker Calibration Tools:

This toolkit should prove the nesseseary tools and workflow to allow the
detectors to be calibrated. Please follow the instructions to operate
the calibration functionality.

Version Control via git.


Requirements:
pyROOT.



Workflow:

1) Use the BiasCalibrator to find the optimum biases for the
   VLPC modules.
   This can be run with BiasCalibratorUI to get a nice GUI to
   validate the calibration.

   The output values from this excersize should be copied into:
   > Tracker XML Files for bias setting.
   > calib_folder/Biases.txt - List of each modules bias setting.
   > calib_folder/BadFE.txt - List of bad front end channels (do not make normal peaks).
   Note these files are made by hand.
   

2) Make a new working folder like 2015-01a, using the
   config there as a template.
   Then launch ADCCalibrator, with first argument as the fodler
   created for calibrations. This will try to automatically fit all
   the data.
   Note that using the external LED data has been cut out, 
   however it can be re-enabled by un-commenting lines in the ADCCalibrator 
   script.
   
   
3) Validate the data by looking over it. This can be completed using
   the ADCCalibratorUI script, which makes a nice GUI. Hand edit values which
   are incorrect.
